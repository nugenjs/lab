# POSTGRESQL

## Reasons for choosing PostgreSQL:
- Open source
- Flexible with data structures (JSONB)
- Follows SQL standards closely

## Notes
- Use snake_case for naming conventions (tables, columns, etc), as by default PostgreSQL folds to lowercase.

# Install
brew install postgresql@15

# Start
brew services start postgresql@15
